# P-Hacking-ML
Repository for my SecTalks talk/exercises.

I don't own a lot of the data used in these exercises.
If the owners of any of the data feel this counts as a misuse of it, please shoot me a message and I'm happy to deconflict any issues.
This is all done to try to help people learn about the pitfalls of different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in an attempt to improve overall ML security by getting people thinking about ML, and to make sure that testers are aware of the inner working of ML and not treating it as a black box when testing them for vulnerabilities.

For the exercises to work, make sure you have a 64 bit of python 3.7 installed, and then install the requirements with pip. 

Thanks for stopping by,
Jankh.
